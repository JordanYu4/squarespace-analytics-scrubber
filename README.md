A WIP console script to scrub google search keyword for CSV data in the SquareSpace Analytics dashboard. 

The current dashboard isn't currently set up to easily export data in PDF or CSV format. 

Script written with help from [Walter Tross's stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18849208).
